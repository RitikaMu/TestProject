                Durga Puja, also known as Durgotsava or Sharodotsava, 
                is an annual Hindu festival originating in the Indian subcontinent which reveres 
                and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga and is also celebrated because of Durga's victory over Mahishahur.
                The festival is observed in the Indian calendar month of Ashwin, which corresponds to Septemberâ€“October in the Gregorian
                calendar.Durga Puja, is a ten-day festival,  of which the last five are of the most significance.
                The puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and structural decorations known as pandals.
                Durga puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism, 
                in which the Ram Lila dance-drama is enacted, celebrating the victory of Rama against Ravana, and effigies of Ravana are burnt.
